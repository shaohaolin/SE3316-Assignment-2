This project is for practicing HTML, JS and XML.

Using HTML and JS to read an local disk XML file and create a table to show requirement contexts.

Also show an summary of the XML file.


Learning experience:

1. JS DOM getElementsByTagName will check all the same tag name in given domain or scope.

2. JS using parseInt("String") //convert String to Int

3. document.write function will refresh a html page. It's better to call this function when the page is loading. Otherwise it will overlap the content in current page.

4. Create a basic dropdown list in HTML and interact with the database using onchange() function.
